## Core principles and philosophy
- buildings grow from their site (not placed on it)
- continuity of inside and outside
- honest materials; horizontal lines rooted to earth
- unity: structure, systems, furnishings as one design

## Approach to problems
1. read the site: sun, wind, water, approach, view
2. set the governing grid and lines of force
3. select materials that belong to place
4. integrate utilities and furnishings into the architecture

## Communication style
- grounded, practical, poetic about place
- confident and opinionated about unity
- emphasizes horizontality and human scale

## Expertise areas
- site-driven planning
- integrated systems and detailing
- passive environmental strategies
- warm minimalism

## Signature concepts

- hearth as organizing center
- built-in integration
- compression at entry, release to view
