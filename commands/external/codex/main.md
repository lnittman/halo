## codex cli usage patterns

### installation
```bash
# check if installed
which codex || {
  # install via npm (preferred)
  npm install -g @openai/codex
  # or via homebrew
  brew install codex
}
```

### authentication methods
```bash
# option 1: chatgpt plan (plus, pro, team)
codex login

# option 2: openai api key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### approval modes
- **suggest** (default): reads files, proposes changes, requires approval
- **auto-edit**: reads and writes files automatically, asks before commands
- **full-auto**: autonomous operation with sandboxing

### key arguments
- `-m, --model`: ALWAYS USE GPT-5 for deep reasoning and analysis
- `--auto-edit`: enable automatic file editing
- `--full-auto`: enable full autonomous mode
- `--sandbox`: control sandbox level (read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access)
- `--ask-for-approval`: approval policy (never, on-request, untrusted)
- `--profile`: use predefined configuration profile

### multimodal capabilities
- accepts text prompts
- processes screenshots and images
- analyzes diagrams and visual content
- generates code from visual mockups

<execution_workflow>
## actual execution with bash tool

when executing, you MUST:

1. **check codex installation**
```bash
which codex || npm install -g @openai/codex
```

2. **prepare strategic prompt**
```bash
cat > .codex-prompt.txt << 'EOF'
[Your research/debugging task here]
EOF
```

3. **execute with appropriate mode**
```bash
# for research and exploration (safe mode) - ALWAYS USE GPT-5
codex -m gpt-5 --sandbox read-only "Think deeply and reason step-by-step: $(cat .codex-prompt.txt)"

# for implementation planning (with file writes)
codex -m gpt-5 --auto-edit "Think deeply and reason step-by-step: $(cat .codex-prompt.txt)"

# for autonomous execution (sandboxed)
codex -m gpt-5 --full-auto --sandbox workspace-write "Think deeply and reason step-by-step: $(cat .codex-prompt.txt)"
```

4. **non-interactive execution for ci/cd**
```bash
codex exec -m gpt-5 -s read-only "Think deeply: analyze architecture patterns"
```
</execution_workflow>

<best_practices>
## codex cli best practices

### approval mode selection
- use `--sandbox read-only` for research and analysis
- use `--auto-edit` for controlled file modifications
- use `--full-auto` only in isolated environments
- always use version control before auto modes

### prompt engineering
- provide clear success criteria
- include relevant context and constraints
- specify desired output format
- reference existing code patterns

### safety considerations
- review proposed changes before approval
- use sandboxing for untrusted operations
- maintain backups before major changes
- test in isolated environments first

### optimal use cases
- architectural decision making
- complex debugging investigations
- performance optimization research
- security vulnerability analysis
- technical debt assessment
- migration planning
- technology evaluation
</best_practices>

<execution_patterns>
## common execution patterns

### quick analysis
```bash
# code review - ALWAYS USE GPT-5
codex -m gpt-5 "Think deeply: review this codebase for architectural patterns and anti-patterns"

# security audit
codex -m gpt-5 "Think deeply: analyze for security vulnerabilities following OWASP guidelines"

# performance analysis  
codex -m gpt-5 "Think deeply: identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"
```

### strategic planning
```bash
# architecture planning
PROMPT="Design a migration strategy from monolith to microservices:
- Current: Django monolith with PostgreSQL
- Target: Kubernetes microservices
- Constraints: Zero downtime, 6-month timeline
- Team: 5 engineers"

codex -m gpt-5 --auto-edit "Think deeply: $PROMPT"
```

### debugging workflow
```bash
# complex debugging
ERROR_CONTEXT=$(cat error.log debug.log | tail -200)
codex -m gpt-5 "Think deeply: Debug this production issue: $ERROR_CONTEXT"

# root cause analysis
codex exec -m gpt-5 --full-auto "Think deeply: perform root cause analysis on the memory leak in worker.js"
```

### ci/cd integration
```bash
# automated pr review
codex exec -m gpt-5 -s read-only \
  "Think deeply: review pr changes and suggest improvements"

# test generation
codex exec -m gpt-5 --auto-edit "Think deeply: generate comprehensive tests for new features"
```
</execution_patterns>

<integration_notes>
## integration with halo system

### workflow coordination
```bash
# after gemini analysis
codex "based on the security audit in audit.md, create a remediation plan"

# before cursor-agent build
codex "research best practices for implementing oauth2 with pkce"

# architecture decisions
codex "evaluate tradeoffs between graphql and rest for our api redesign"
```

### agent handoffs
- use codex for strategic planning â†’ cursor-agent for implementation
- use gemini for analysis â†’ codex for solution design
- use codex for debugging â†’ cursor-agent for fixes

### output formats
- codex provides markdown documentation
- generates architectural decision records
- creates implementation roadmaps
- produces debugging reports
