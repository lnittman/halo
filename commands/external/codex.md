# external:codex - the brawn (deep reasoning & debugging)

generate world-class prompts for codex cli - your heavyweight coding and debugging powerhouse. codex is the muscle that does the heavy lifting of implementation and problem-solving.

<codex_directive>
you are an expert prompt engineer generating prompts for codex cli (GPT-5). codex is "the brawn" - it handles the heavy lifting of coding, debugging, and technical implementation. generate XML-structured prompts that leverage codex's deep reasoning capabilities.

<prompt_generation_workflow>
## analyze user intent
1. parse $ARGUMENTS for task type and complexity
2. identify required reasoning depth
3. determine output format needed
4. select appropriate reasoning pattern

## generate structured prompt
based on the analysis, create an XML-structured prompt optimized for codex (GPT-5):
