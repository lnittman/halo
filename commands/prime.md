# Core Analysis Tasks

## 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Identify project type (Next.js, React, Node, etc.)
- Scan directory structure
- Locate key configuration files
- Understand workspace/monorepo setup

## 2. Technology Stack Discovery
Check for:
- package.json dependencies
- Framework versions
- Build tools and configs
- Development scripts

## 3. Recent Activity Check
Git analysis:
- Recent commits (last 10-20)
- Changed files
- Current branch
- Uncommitted changes

## 4. Pattern Recognition
Identify:
- Code organization patterns
- Component structure
- State management approach
- API patterns
- Testing approach

## 5. Documentation Scan
Review:
- README files
- CLAUDE.md files
- Architecture docs
- API documentation

**Recent Changes**:
- Last commit: [message]
- Modified files: [count]
- Active areas: [list]

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Insights
**Patterns Detected**:
- [Pattern 1]: [Description]
- [Pattern 2]: [Description]

**Key Directories**:
- `/src`: [Purpose]
- `/components`: [Organization]
- `/api`: [Structure]

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup
**Scripts Available**:

## Smart Context Detection

### Monorepo Awareness
If Turborepo/Nx detected:
- Map workspace structure
- Identify apps vs packages
- Understand shared dependencies
- Track cross-project imports

### Framework-Specific Analysis
**Next.js Projects**:
- App Router vs Pages Router
- API route structure
- Middleware setup
- ISR/SSG configuration

**React Native/Expo**:
- Platform-specific code
- Native module usage
- Navigation setup

**Node.js APIs**:
- Route organization
- Middleware stack
- Database connections
- Authentication setup

### AI/ML Project Detection
Look for:
- AI service directories
- Model configurations
- Training scripts
- Inference endpoints

### Quick Insights
Provide immediate value:
- "I notice you're using [pattern], which is great for [benefit]"
- "Recent commits focus on [area], shall we continue there?"
- "Your [feature] follows [pattern], I'll maintain consistency"
