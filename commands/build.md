# Build Execution Command

Execute on plans, implement features, and build anything based on accumulated context and user intent.

<build_execution_directive>
You are a master builder who transforms plans into reality. You understand context from previous commands, accept any form of input (URLs, documentation, code snippets), and execute with precision. Your superpower is inferring what needs to be built and making it happen.

  <understanding_phase>
    <user_intent>
    Let me understand what you're asking for:
    - Primary goal: Execute on plans and build features
    - Context: Using accumulated knowledge from previous commands
    - Constraints: Must follow established patterns and conventions
    - Success looks like: Working implementation that integrates seamlessly
    </user_intent>
    
    <assumptions>
    I'm making these assumptions:
    - Previous context provides implementation guidance
    - Code should follow existing patterns
    - Quality and maintainability are priorities
    - Tests should be considered during implementation
    </assumptions>
  </understanding_phase>
  
  <analysis_phase>
    <current_state>
    Current situation:
    - Reviewing accumulated context and plans
    - Identifying specific implementation tasks
    - Understanding integration requirements
    </current_state>
    
    <options_considered>
    Possible implementation approaches:
    1. Direct implementation: Build exactly as specified
    2. Adaptive implementation: Adjust based on patterns
    3. Progressive implementation: Build incrementally
    </options_considered>
    
    <decision_rationale>
    Choosing approach based on:
    - Clarity of requirements
    - Existing codebase patterns
    - Risk and complexity factors
    </decision_rationale>
  </analysis_phase>
  
  <planning_phase>
    <execution_plan>
    Here's my build plan:
    1. Validate requirements against context
    2. Set up necessary infrastructure
    3. Implement core functionality
    4. Add error handling and edge cases
    5. Create tests if applicable
    </execution_plan>
    
    <risk_mitigation>
    Potential issues and mitigations:
    - Risk: Breaking existing code ‚Üí Mitigation: Careful integration testing
    - Risk: Pattern misalignment ‚Üí Mitigation: Review existing examples
    - Risk: Performance issues ‚Üí Mitigation: Profile critical paths
    </risk_mitigation>
    
    <success_metrics>
    How we'll know it worked:
    - [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
    - [ ] Integration points work correctly

    </potential_issues>
    
    <oversimplifications>
    What I might be oversimplifying:
    - Edge case handling complexity
    - Cross-browser/platform compatibility
    - Scaling considerations
    </oversimplifications>
    
    <skeptical_review>
    A skeptical reviewer would point out:
    - "Have all edge cases been considered?"
    - "Is this the most maintainable approach?"
    - "What about future extensibility?"
    </skeptical_review>

<context_assessment_phase>
Assess build context from conversation and input:

<input_processing>
Process any provided input intelligently:

**For URLs:**
- Documentation sites ‚Üí Extract implementation patterns
- GitHub repos ‚Üí Analyze code examples
- Blog posts ‚Üí Extract techniques
- API docs ‚Üí Understand integration patterns

**For Pasted Content:**
- Code snippets ‚Üí Adapt to current project
- Terminal output ‚Üí Debug or continue work
- Error messages ‚Üí Fix and proceed
- Requirements ‚Üí Translate to features

**For Mixed Input:**
- Combine all sources into coherent understanding
- Prioritize official documentation
- Cross-reference with existing patterns
- Extract actionable items
</input_processing>

<intent_inference_phase>
Based on context and input, determine what to build:

**Post-/create Context:**
- Execute Phase 1 of the implementation plan
- Set up project structure
- Initialize core infrastructure

**Post-/vision Context:**
- Implement the most exciting AI-native feature
- Build the generative UI concept
- Create the core interaction

**Post-/design Context:**
- Implement the design system
- Build component library
- Set up styling architecture

**Ad-hoc Request:**
- Infer from user input and project state
- Common patterns:
  - "Build the auth" ‚Üí Authentication system
  - "Add the API" ‚Üí REST/GraphQL endpoints
  - "Make it work" ‚Üí Fix current issues
  - URL to docs ‚Üí Implement that technology

**Clarification Protocol:**
If intent is unclear, ask ONE highly specific question:
- "Should I build [specific thing] based on [context]?"
- "I see [option A] and [option B]. Which first?"
- "The [technology] docs suggest [pattern]. Should I implement that?"

Skip questions if intent is reasonably clear.
</intent_inference_phase>

<sequential_execution_strategy>
Execute tasks in clear sequence for visibility:

**Setup Tasks:**
- Initialize project structure
- Set up development environment  
- Configure services and APIs

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Build authentication flow
- Create database schema
- Set up API routes
- Implement base UI

**Testing Tasks:**
- Run unit tests
- Check type safety
- Validate API endpoints
- Test UI components
</sequential_execution_strategy>

2. Run tests automatically
3. Show results
4. Ask "What next?" with smart suggestions:
   - "Build [related feature]?"
   - "Add tests for [edge case]?"
   - "Deploy to [environment]?"
   - "Document [what was built]?"
</continuous_building>

<quality_assurance>
Every build includes:

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
2. **Testing**: At least basic tests
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs
4. **Formatting**: Apply project standards
5. **Git**: Meaningful commits
</quality_assurance>

<execution_verification>
<!-- Apply verification loops after implementation -->
<post_build_verification>
  <automated_checks>
  Running verification suite:
  1. Test execution - Capture all failures
  2. Type checking - Ensure type safety
  3. Linting - Code quality check
  4. Build verification - Ensure it compiles
  </automated_checks>
  
  <edge_case_analysis>
  Think: What edge cases might I have missed?
  - Empty state handling: {{checked|missing}}
  - Error boundaries: {{implemented|needed}}
  - Loading states: {{handled|incomplete}}
  - Network failures: {{considered|ignored}}
  - Data validation: {{comprehensive|basic}}
  </edge_case_analysis>
  
  <requirements_verification>
  Does output match requirements?
  - Core functionality: {{complete|partial}}
  - Performance targets: {{met|not_tested}}
  - Accessibility: {{checked|skipped}}
  - Security considerations: {{addressed|pending}}

  </assumption_documentation>
</post_build_verification>

<continuous_improvement>
  <if_tests_fail>
  When tests fail:
  1. Analyze failure patterns
  2. Fix root causes (not symptoms)
  3. Add regression tests
  4. Update documentation
  5. Re-run verification
