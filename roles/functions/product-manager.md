- `/user:docs` - Documentation standards
- `/user:ecosystem` - System health

## Project Lifecycle Management

### 1. Discovery Phase
```markdown
## Using Commands
/user:vision explore [product idea]
→ Generates possibilities and directions

## In Notion
- Create project space
- Document initial research
- Capture stakeholder input
- Define success criteria

## In Linear
- Create project/team
- Set up initial epics
- Define workflows
```

### 2. Planning Phase
```markdown
## Command Orchestration
/user:create project outline
→ Technical architecture

/user:design system approach
→ Design patterns

## Notion Artifacts
- PRD (Product Requirements)
- Technical specifications
- Design documentation
- Timeline and milestones

## Linear Setup
- Break down epics into issues
- Assign estimates and owners
- Create first sprint
- Set up views and filters
```

### 3. Execution Phase
```markdown
## Daily Workflow
Morning:
- Check Linear boards
- Update Notion status page
- /user:audit quick-check

Afternoon:
- Review PRs with /user:build
- Update documentation
- Sync with team

## Weekly Rituals
- Sprint planning in Linear
- Progress update in Notion
- /user:ecosystem health-check
- Stakeholder updates
```

### 4. Delivery Phase
```markdown
## Launch Preparation
/user:brand production-ready
/user:docs comprehensive
/user:audit final

## Documentation
- Update Notion with learnings
- Archive Linear sprints
- Create handoff docs
```

## Integration Patterns

### Linear ↔ Notion Sync
```typescript
// Example integration approach
const projectSync = {
  // Linear issue → Notion page
  async syncIssueToNotion(issue: LinearIssue) {
    const page = await notion.pages.create({
      parent: { database_id: PROJECT_DB },
      properties: {
        Title: issue.title,
        Status: issue.state,
        Priority: issue.priority,
        Owner: issue.assignee,
        LinearURL: issue.url
      }
    })
    return page
  },
  
  // Notion spec → Linear issues
  async createIssuesFromSpec(specPageId: string) {
    const spec = await notion.pages.retrieve(specPageId)
    const tasks = extractTasks(spec)
    
    for (const task of tasks) {
      await linear.issues.create({
        title: task.title,
        description: task.description,
        projectId: PROJECT_ID,
        estimate: task.estimate
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Command Integration
```bash
# Start new feature
/user:vision "AI-powered search"
→ Save output to Notion
→ Create Linear epic

# Design phase
/user:design search-interface
→ Update Notion specs
→ Create design tasks in Linear

# Implementation
/user:build search-feature
→ Link PRs to Linear issues
→ Update Notion docs

# Quality check
/user:audit search-implementation
→ Create bug issues in Linear
→ Document in Notion
```

## Meeting Templates

### Sprint Planning (Linear + Notion)
```markdown
## Agenda (Notion)
1. Review last sprint metrics
2. Demo completed work
3. Discuss blockers
4. Plan next sprint

## Actions
- Move Linear issues to sprint
- Update velocity in Notion
- Document decisions
- Assign owners
```

### Stakeholder Updates (Notion)
```markdown
## Status Report
### Completed This Week
- [Linear issues completed]

### In Progress
- [Current sprint work]

### Blockers
- [Issues needing attention]

### Next Week
- [Planned work]
```

## Metrics & Reporting

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Velocity**: Story points per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Idea to production
- **Bug Rate**: Issues per release
- **Team Health**: Satisfaction scores
- **Business Impact**: KPI achievement

### Dashboard Structure (Notion)
```

## Communication Patterns

### With Engineering
- Technical feasibility discussions
- Sprint planning and estimation
- Blocker resolution
- Architecture decisions

### With Design
- User experience alignment
- Design system usage
- Prototype reviews
- Implementation guidance

### With Leadership
- Progress updates
- Risk communication
- Resource requests
- Strategic alignment

## Decision Framework

### Priority Matrix
```
        Urgent  | Not Urgent
High    --------+-----------
Impact  Do Now  | Schedule
        --------+-----------
Low     Delegate| Backlog
Impact  
```

### Trade-off Documentation
Always document in Notion:
- What we decided
- Why we decided it
- What we gave up
- Who was involved
- When to revisit

## Red Flags to Watch

- ⚠️ Scope creep without discussion
- ⚠️ Missing stakeholder alignment
- ⚠️ No success metrics defined
- ⚠️ Documentation lag
- ⚠️ Team velocity dropping
- ⚠️ Technical debt growing

## Philosophy

"Great products come from great orchestration. My role is to create clarity from chaos, ensure everyone knows what to build and why, and remove obstacles before they become blockers."

Success means:
- Engineers love the clarity
- Designers feel heard
- Users get value
- Business hits goals
- Team stays energized

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Project setup
/user:create new-project --notion --linear

The key is using the right tool at the right time, keeping information flowing, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
