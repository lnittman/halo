| **Builders** | motion-expert, 3d-artist, video-studio, polish-interface | Planning needed | ⏳ Pending |
| **Integrations** | github-whisperer, cloudflare-whisperer, linear-whisperer | Output templates added | ✅ Partial |
| **Specialists** | tech-docs, test-coverage, dependency-doctor, github-analyzer | Output templates, some thinking | ✅ Partial |
| **Refiners** | simplify-design, docs-generator, stack-expert-dev, tech-researcher | Output templates added | ✅ Partial |
| **Roles** | product-orchestrator, ai-architect, design-systems-architect | Full integration | ✅ Complete |

## 🔧 Standardization Patterns Applied

### 1. Component Declaration
All new role-based agents include:
```xml
<components>
  <use>@thinking-blocks</use>
  <use>@verification-patterns</use>
  <use>@output-standards</use>
  <use>@planning-phases</use>
</components>
```

### 2. Thinking Process Integration
Agents now show structured reasoning:
```xml
<thinking_process>
  <understanding_phase>
    What I understand: [interpretation]
    Context: [relevant details]
  </understanding_phase>
  
  <analysis_phase>
    Options: [approaches]
    Selected: [choice]
    Rationale: [reasoning]
  </analysis_phase>
  
  <planning_phase>
    Steps: [execution plan]
  </planning_phase>
</thinking_process>
```

### 3. Verification Patterns
Safety checks before operations:
```xml
<verification_phase>
  <scope_check>
    What will change: [impacts]
    Risk level: [assessment]
  </scope_check>
  
  <confirmation>
    Proceeding with: [action]
    Expected outcome: [result]
  </confirmation>
</verification_phase>
```

### 4. Output Standardization
All agents now use consistent report formats with:
- Emoji-rich headers (🎯, 📊, ✅)
- Metadata section (timestamps, status)
- Structured sections
- Visual indicators (progress bars, health scores)
- Clear next steps
- Attribution footers

## 📁 New Role-Based Agents Created

### commands/role/
1. **product-orchestrator.md** - Strategic project management with Linear integration
2. **ai-architect.md** - AI system design with Mastra and Vercel AI SDK
3. **design-systems-architect.md** - Component library architecture with shadcn/ui

These demonstrate full component integration patterns.

## 🔄 Integration Benefits

### Consistency
- All agents follow similar thinking patterns
- Predictable output formats
- Standardized verification processes
- Common status indicators

### Transparency
- Visible reasoning process
- Clear decision rationale
- Documented safety checks
- Traceable workflows

### Composability
- Agents can use shared components
- Common patterns reduce duplication
- Easier to maintain and update
- Better inter-agent communication

## 📋 Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Complete Builder Agent Integration**
   - Add thinking-blocks to creative agents
   - Integrate planning-phases for complex builds
   - Add verification for file operations

2. **Standardize Remaining Analyzers**
   - Full component integration
   - Consistent thinking patterns
   - Unified output formats

### Medium Priority
3. **Create More Role-Based Agents**
   - performance-engineer
   - full-stack-architect
   - Additional personas (dieter-rams, etc.)

4. **Test Component Integration**
   - Verify thinking process flow
   - Test verification patterns
   - Validate output consistency

### Low Priority
5. **Create Agent Testing Framework**
   - Component usage validation
   - Output format checking
   - Integration testing

## 🎨 Best Practices Established

### For New Agents
1. Always include component declaration
2. Use thinking-blocks for complex decisions
3. Add verification before dangerous operations
4. Follow output-standards templates
5. Document integration points

### For Existing Agents
1. Add components incrementally
2. Preserve existing functionality
3. Test after each change
4. Update documentation
5. Maintain backward compatibility

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Continue Standardization**: Apply patterns to remaining agents
2. **Create Agent Library**: More role-based agents for common functions
3. **Build Testing Suite**: Ensure consistency across agents
4. **Document Patterns**: Create developer guide for agent creation
5. **Optimize Performance**: Measure and improve agent efficiency
